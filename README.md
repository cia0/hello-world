# hello-world
This being my first repository there won't be anything too exciting to investigate.
However, if you find homework to be exciting this is where you'll find some of my past homework assignments.

If you are an employer and would like to see my work done as University of Waterloo Software Engineering Student, please contact me via email at marcusp.kruger@gmail.com .

So I've been dabbling around with Python for a few years now and am hoping to hop into some beginner friendly open source project. Recently, through Harvard's CS50 and some software engineering courses at Waterloo, I have also been learning C/C++. This is what most of projects have been in. I have basic very very basic knowledge of Javascript, SQl, JSON, and HTML/CSS.
I really enjoy Reece's, reading, and going on adventures when the occasion arises.
