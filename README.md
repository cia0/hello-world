# hello-world
This being my first repository there won't be anything too exciting to investigate

So I've been dabbling around with Python for a few years now and am hoping to hop into some beginner friendly open source project. I have basic knowledge of Javascript, PHP, XML, JSON, and HTML/CSS
I really enjoy Reece's, reading, and going on adventures when the occasion arises.
