1.  stdint.h is a header file that allows for specific variable length. Although it is low level, it promotes portability and sleeker design because it so explicitly denotes variables' size.
2.  Using uint8_t, for example, documents that you will be storing small numbers. It is also aesthetically pleasing if you are using the other typedefs from stdint.h.
3.  BYTE is 1 byte. DWORD and LONG are 8 bytes. WORD is 4 bytes.
4.  BM
5.  bfSize refers to the size of the bitmap headerfile and is 8 bytes. biSize refers to the size of the bitmap info header and is only 4 bytes.
6.  If biHeight is negative then the bitmap is upside down and its origin is the upper-left corner.
7.  biBitCount specifies the BMP's colour depth.
8.  fopen might return NULL if there isn't enough memory available to create the file or if the program doesn't have permission.
9.  The third argument of fread() is always 1 because the section being read is being read as one chunk.
10. Line 65 of copy.c assigns padding a value of 3 if bi.Width is 3.
11. fseek() redirects the where a file is being read. This is useful if you wanted to skip over a part.
12. SEEK_CUR is the current position of the file pointer.
